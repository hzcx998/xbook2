$BUILTIN wait
$FUNCTION wait_builtin
$DEPENDS_ON JOB_CONTROL
$PRODUCES wait.c
$SHORT_DOC wait [-fn] [-p var] [id ...]
Wait for job completion and return exit status.

Waits for each process identified by an ID, which may be a process ID or a
job specification, and reports its termination status.  If ID is not
given, waits for all currently active child processes, and the return
status is zero.  If ID is a job specification, waits for all processes
in that job's pipeline.

If the -n option is supplied, waits for a single job from the list of IDs,
or, if no IDs are supplied, for the next job to complete and returns its
exit status.

If the -p option is supplied, the process or job identifier of the job
for which the exit status is returned is assigned to the variable VAR
named by the option argument. The variable will be unset initially, before
any assignment. This is useful only when the -n option is supplied.

If the -f option is supplied, and job control is enabled, waits for the
specified ID to terminate, instead of waiting for it to change status.

Exit Status:
Returns the status of the last ID; fails if ID is invalid or an invalid
option is given, or if -n is supplied and the shell has no unwaited-for
children.
$END

$BUILTIN wait
$FUNCTION wait_builtin
$DEPENDS_ON !JOB_CONTROL
$SHORT_DOC wait [pid ...]
Wait for process completion and return exit status.

Waits for each process specified by a PID and reports its termination status.
If PID is not given, waits for all currently active child processes,
and the return status is zero.  PID must be a process ID.

Exit Status:
Returns the status of the last PID; fails if PID is invalid or an invalid
option is given.
